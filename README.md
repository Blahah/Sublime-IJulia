Sublime-IJulia
======

Successor to the Sublime-Julia project, now based on the IJulia backend.

Julia is a new, open-source technical computing language built for speed and simplicity. The IJulia project
built an IPython kernel for Julia to provide the typical IPython frontend-backend functionality such as
the popular notebook, qtconsole, and regular terminal. 

Sublime-IJulia builds on these efforts by providing a frontend to the IJulia backend kernel. All within Sublime, 
a user can start up an IJulia frontend in a Sublime view and interact with the kernel. This allows for rapid 
code development through REPL testing and debugging without ever having to leave our favorite editor.

This project is still in beta, so please be patient and open issues liberally.
